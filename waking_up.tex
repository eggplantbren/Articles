\maketitle

About a decade ago, I became very close friends with a man who happened to be
a fundamentalist Christian. I had grown up around those ideas and rejected
them, and was quite passionately anti-religious. Naively, I thought it would be
a good idea to go to his Bible study group and ask more questions than would
ever be productive. That idea was as unproductive as it sounds.
One memory from those nights that I vividly recall was a parishioner's
passionate description of their profoundly emotional conversion experience.
Since this had occurred in a Christian context, he interpreted this experience
in the terms of that religion.

...


{\em Waking Up} is a fascinating read, and I found it utterly
compelling on the {\em why} of non-sectarian spiritual practices. It's not as
strong on the {\em how}, and doesn't quite live up to its subtitle's claim of
being a guide. I would still strongly recommend it to anyone interested in
the quality of their own mind.
