\maketitle

The second law of thermodynamics has got to qualify as one of the most
misunderstood principles in all of physics. Depending on who you ask, it is
either incredibly mysterious or entirely mundane. It might be connected to
fundamental ideas such as time and the origin of the universe
\citep{carroll}. Or maybe not.

Why is golf difficult?
Why can't most men sing operatic high Cs?
Why are three-pointers harder to `hit' in basketball than two-pointers?

I first encountered the second law
as a teenager, while reading a copy of {\em Creation} magazine given to me
by my grandmother. Being a creationist magazine, it defined the second law as
the idea that {\em disorder always increases with time}.
At first glance, this seems incompatible with evolution by
natural selection, which can lead to more complex,
``better designed'' organisms over time \citep{dawkins}.

A similar, related question is that of how natural selection
puts information into the genome. Reasonable responses include those by
\citep{dawkins2} and \citep{mackay}.

The second law has also been invoked in arguments about the
sustainability of industrial civilization \citep{muse}. Attenborough

During my PhD studies, I came across a wonderful paper by the late physicist
E. T. Jaynes, which might be my favourite physics paper of all time
\citep{jaynes}. As with all my favourite papers, I didn't understand it
immediately, but had a strong feeling that I should persist because it seemed
important and profound. Every so often, I'd return to re-read it, understanding
just a little more each time. Then, the breakthrough came after dinner one
night. I took out a tub of ice-cream from the freezer for dessert. After dishing
the ice-cream into a bowl, I tried putting the tub back in the freezer, but
it wouldn't fit. Suddenly it clicked: the second law of thermodynamics is the
principle that {\em big things cannot fit into small spaces, unless you can
compress them}.

I must admit that when I hear `entropy' from a physicist, without a long
set of qualifications, I don't know what they're talking about.
I don't think this is my fault.

There seems to be little recognition of the fact
that the {\em exact same physical system}
can have more than one entropy, depending on how we want to think about it.
What {\em rules of thumb} are we looking for? Different ones may exist, and
we'll find them by using different entropies.
